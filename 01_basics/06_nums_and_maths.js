console.log(newScore.toString().charAt(0)); //This line will give you the character that is at 0 index

console.log(newScore.toString().indexOf("5")); //This line will give you the index of 5

console.log(newScore.toFixed(3)); //This line will give you the newScore with upto 3 decimal points => parameter given as 3 => Mostly used on the E-commerce websites so that the customer doesn't get irritated because of so many decimals


// ****** Some other methods ******
const balance = 24.467;

const maxNumber = Number.MAX_VALUE;
console.log(maxNumber);//Returns the max possible number that can be stored in JS => Value greater than this number is considered as infinity âˆž 

const minNumber = Number.MIN_VALUE;

/* Maths */

console.log(Math);//This line will give you all the maths method

console.log(Math.abs(-5));// This line will change negative to positive and positive will remain same

console.log(Math.round(5.5)); //This line will round of the number

console.log(Math.ceil(5.2));//This line will round up the number

console.log(Math.floor(7.8));//This line will round down the number

console.log(Math.max(1, 2, 3, 5));//This line will give the max value from the array

/* Using Math.random method properly */
const max = 150;

console.log(Math.floor(Math.random()  * (max - min + 1)) + min);// This will give a random number ranging from 100 - 150
